#National Parks app
This app is a SwiftUI REST client backed by the National Parks Service API. This app will allow users to explore national parks , conveniently filtered by state. By selecting a park, users can navigate to a detail screen offering more comprehensive information about the park, additional images, and a map showcasing the park's location.
